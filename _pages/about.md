<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an Embodied AI student researcher currently working at Northeastern University (Foshan), under the supervision of Professor [Xiaoguang Ma](http://www.ise.neu.edu.cn/2021/0909/c6131a202809/page.htm). Recently, I am focusing on research in Agentic UAVs. Prior to this, I received my Master's degree in Electronic Information from Zhejiang University of Technology in June 2024, where my work was dedicated to developing visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) algorithms for ground mobile robots to achieve visual navigation in dynamic scenes.

# 📚 Research Vision
My current research focuses on developing self-improving / self-evolving embodied navigation agents, and exploring their applications in aerial and ground robots. In the long run, my research vision is to build an embodied agent that can autonomously perceive, make decisions, and learn continuously like humans. To achieve this, I primarily focus on:
1. Language-driven visual navigation (e.g., VLN and ObjectNav).
2. Large foundation models (e.g., LLMs and VLMs) and their training techniques.
4. Lifelong learning of LLM / VLM-powered agents.
5. Vision-Language-Action models and their applications.

[**Project**]((https://example.com/paper1)) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework was proposed.
